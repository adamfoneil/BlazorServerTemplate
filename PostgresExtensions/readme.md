This is a place for Postgres features that I wanted to be reusable outside the Application.

# DataExporter
If you want to provide a way for users to export data, such as downloading a copy of their data from the app, this is what [DataExporter](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorServerTemplate/blob/main/PostgresExtensions/DataExporter.cs) is for. I don't have a working example yet in the template, but I'll document an example I'm using in another closed-source app.
